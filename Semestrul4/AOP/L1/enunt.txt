  Laborator 1: Tracing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Modify the code from one of the labs from Advanced Programming Methods
  (Individual Project or Observer) to trace the execution of each public method 
  (name and parameters) using Logging  or Log4J.

  Count the number of classes and methods that you have modified, the number of 
  source code lines that you have added, and the time needed for modification.
