  Laborator 3: Observer with AOP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Modify the problem with the Observer pattern from APM to use the AOP-based
  implementation of the Observer design pattern. 

  Define an annotation, annotate the methods that change the state of the 
  subject, and define a pointcut using the annotation.
